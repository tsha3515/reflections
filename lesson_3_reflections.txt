When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	-When you need to keep a backup
	-When you are working on a file from multiple devices
	-When collaborating on a file with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Every sync is a commit, so frequent updates can clutter the commit
	history. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	A fork clones another repo from within GitHub to your account and attributes
	the original. Clone copies a repo and it's history, locally or from
	Github/etc. Branches are versions of workspace within a repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
